# genetic-algorithm-for-detecting-best-n-sided-polygon

have to Generate Random Simple Polygons using Genetic Algorithm and CSP. You
are required to generate random simple polygons, which is a polygon having no intersecting edges, from a
given set of points called S= {p 1 , p 2 ,â€¦, p n }, where and the points lie in a two dimensional plane. Your
algorithm should make convex polygons.
The steps required to get to the solution are:
1. Design a chromosome for the problem [Must be binary Encoded]
2. Define Genetic operators for the problem. They can be different than standard Mutation and
crossover.
3. Define a Fitness function.
4. Roulette Wheel selection.
5. RUN GA using above chromosome, genetic operator, fitness function and selection function.
the solution will work on any n, where n is the number of points, they can be between 3-15
